# Title Case

*Goal*:
A small module to format a string into title case.

*Using the Guideline*:
""The Quick Brown Fox Jumps over the Lazy Dog""
"A mixed-case style with all words capitalised, except for certain subsets (particularly articles and short prepositions and conjunctions) defined by rules that are not universally standardised. The standardisation is only at the level of house styles and individual style manuals. (See further explanation below at ยง Headings and publication titles.) In text processing, title case usually involves the capitalisation of all words irrespective of their part of speech. This simplified variant of title case is also known as start case or initial caps."

To remind myself where I left off...

- Test a preposition when it is encountered to determine the context. If it is used alone, next to other verbs, then it is OK. If it is used next to conjunctions, they both need to be lowercase.
- If a preposition is preceeded by a semi-colon, capitalize it.
- Include options to select the academia style (AP/ec) and incorporate rules respectively.
